# Lab 1 - Learn CSS and HTML

## Story

Imagine, you're a frontend developer at TastyFood Inc., a startup from Silicon Valley. Your company creates best-in-class landing pages for stores of all sizes across the globe. One day you receive the following e-mail from your boss.

```
Hi, my dear employee!

As you may know, we have signed a new contract! And guess who -- your favorite grocery store!
We've promised them we'll deliver the first demo of landing page by the end of the month. Please prepare some HTMLs and CSSs by that time.

Cheers,
Your lovely boss. <3
```

The next day the designer sends you the design and you start working on the landing page.

## Task

Your task for this lab is:

1. Download the design as PSD file from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-psd/grocery-delivery-service-web-template_17734553.htm);
2. Extract images as JPG files using [Aspose](https://products.aspose.app/psd/extract) or similiar tools.
3. Copy `index.html`, `reset.css` and `style.css` to your repo;
4. Update `index.html` and `style.css`, so that the page looks similar to the design from PSD file.

## Special conditions

You're not allowed to use any third-party styles, except some utilities (which should be argumented in the report).

## Grading

Points:

- "Groceries. On the go" section - `+4` points
- "Locally sourced block" section - `+2` points
- "Made simple" section - `+2` points
- "FAQ" section - `+2` points

You can get `+2` bonus points for an adapted design for mobile devices.

## Hints

- You can use different photos than ones from design. In this case you should give credits to them.
- It shouldn't be pixel-perfect - don't spend time on minor details.
- The result will be checked in Firefox browser - make sure it looks OK there.
- If you want to create a responsive design, start with the desktop version, then get rid of unnecessary elements for the mobile version.
- For layout, you can use CSS Grid and/or flexboxes.
