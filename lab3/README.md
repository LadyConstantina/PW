# Lab 3 - Learn JavaScript basics

## Story

Imagine, you're a frontend developer from Melbourne, Australia. You and your company Sleep2nigth Pty Ltd are working on a brand new product - smart To-do lists!

You've pitched the idea in the local startup accelerator and you've won first round of investitions. The only thing what's left - to build the app itself.

## Task

1. Copy [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css) and [app.js](app.js) to your repo;
2. Modify them to build an application for to-do list;
3. The app has to cover basic needs:
  - to add to the list;
  - to remove from the list;
  - to mark as done;
  - see "done" and "to-do" lists separately.

4. The app has to look attractive.

## Special conditions

You're not allowed to use any third-party library for JS, except utility packages such as `lodash` or `underscore`. `jquery` is not allowed. If you use third-party CSS libraries/frameworks, make sure they don't use JS.

## Grading

Points:

- basic app - `6` points
- attractive app - `+1` point
- the list is preserved after page refresh - `+1` point;

You can get `+1` point if the app implements a notification mechanism.
You can get `+1` point for each useful feature the app implements, besides the ones listed above (up to `3` points, approved by the teacher).

## Hints

- For UI, you are free to use any CSS library. You can try Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap or Bulma;
- Use the latest standards of ECMAScript (2015 or later) to write JS code;
- To debug JS, put `debugger` somewhere in the code you want to check what's going wrong there, open Developer Tools and then refresh the page;
- Use JS classes to separate business logic from data representation.
